1. npm install @react-navigation/native
2. Installing dependencies
    npm install react-native-reanimated
                react-native-gesture-handler
                react-native-screens
                react-native-safe-area-context
                @react-native-community/masked-view
    ***TWO IMPORTANT STEPS IN NAVIGATION:
        1. Add these below two lines in dependencies section in android/app/build.gradle
            implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.1.0-rc01'
            implementation 'androidx.swiperefreshlayout:swiperefreshlayout:1.1.0-alpha02'
        2. At the TOP OF THE ROOT FILE i.e. EITHER INDEX.JS OR APP.JS
            (I added in index.js)
            import 'react-native-gesture-handler';
3. The above are the BUIDING BLOCKS&  shared foundations for navigators of the NAVIGATOR FUNCTIONALITY IN REACT-NATIVE
    For exmaple: React Navigation's stack navigator provides the gestures and animations
4. We have our basic building blocks ready now we have to choose the NAVIGATOR
5. Each NAVIGATOR in React Navigation lives in its OWN LIBRARY 
6. To use the STACK NAVIGATOR, we need to install @react-navigation/stack (LIBRARY)
    Install: 
            npm install @react-navigation/stack
            (THIS STACK navigator depends on @react-native-community/masked-view & all the above modules i.e BUIDING BLOCKS)
7. createStackNavigator -> return object with 2 properties:
    (Both are react components)
    i) Screen
    ii) Navigator -> should contain Screen elements as its children to define config for ROUTES
    
8. NavigationContainer -> Componenet which manages our NAVIGATION TREE like parent AND CONTAINS NAVIGATION STATE.
    (NavigationContainer component must wrap all navigators structure)
